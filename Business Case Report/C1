Purpose: 
To explore the correlation between the preferred days of the week for bike rides between members vs casual riders.  
Is there a correlation between the preferred days of the week for bike rides between members vs. casual riders?

Why is this useful?
There are patterns in bike usage that can be based on geography and location. Bike usage might only be for those commuting to 
and from work on weekdays vs a spike in bike activity during weekends when people go out for a longer period of time. 
Understanding these patterns can be valuable in business situations for roles related to urban planning, transportation management, 
or even for businesses directly involved in the bike-sharing industry. An example would be if the business desires to convert the 
casual riders to upgrade to members and wants to know the best days for heavy advertisement or recruitment. 

Types of Business Utilization:
Urban Planners: Knowing when and where people tend to use bikes can inform the development of bike lanes, parking facilities, or even the placement of bike-sharing stations.
Transportation Companies: Businesses offering bike-sharing services can optimize their operations by deploying more bikes or adjusting pricing based on peak usage times and popular locations.
Marketing and Sales: Retailers selling bikes or bike-related accessories can tailor their marketing campaigns, discounts, or promotions to align with the days where bike usage is highest.
Data Analysts and Researchers: Professionals in these roles can use this information to conduct deeper analysis, identify trends, and make predictions about future bike usage patterns.
Tourism Industry: In tourist-heavy areas, understanding bike usage patterns can help tour companies plan routes and schedules for bike tours more effectively.
