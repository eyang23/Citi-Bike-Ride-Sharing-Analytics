Purpose: 
To study bike usage patterns across locations at different times aims to reveal geographic influences on daily bicycle utilization.
Are there specific patterns in the usage of bikes based on their geography during different times of the day?

Why is this useful?
Understanding this can guide bike-sharing companies to strategically allocate more resources, such as deploying additional bikes or staffing, during these peak hours to meet heightened demand. It also allows for targeted marketing efforts, directing promotional campaigns toward these specific time frames to attract more users and maximize business potential.

Types of Business Utilization:

Urban Planners: Knowing when and where people tend to use bikes can inform the development of bike lanes, parking facilities, or even the placement of bike-sharing stations.

Transportation Companies: Businesses offering bike-sharing services can optimize their operations by deploying more bikes or adjusting pricing based on peak usage times and popular locations.

Marketing and Sales: Retailers selling bikes or bike-related accessories can tailor their marketing campaigns, discounts, or promotions to align with the days where bike usage is highest.

Data Analysts and Researchers: Professionals in these roles can use this information to conduct deeper analysis, identify trends, and make predictions about future bike usage patterns.

Tourism Industry: In tourist-heavy areas, understanding bike usage patterns can help tour companies plan routes and schedules for bike tours more effectively.
