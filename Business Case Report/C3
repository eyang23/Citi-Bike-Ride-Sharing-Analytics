Purpose: 
To investigate if members and casual riders differ in ride durations based on the day and starting station.
Do members and casual riders tend to take longer, or shorter rides based on the day of the week and the starting station?

Why is this useful? 
Understanding whether members and casual riders take longer, or shorter rides based on the day of the week and starting station can provide insights into user behavior and preferences.

Types of Business Utilization:

Bike Share Operations Managers: Knowing the ride duration based on the day of the week and starting station can help in optimizing bike distribution. If certain stations see longer rides on weekends, they might need more bikes available during those times to meet demand.

Marketing and Sales Teams: Understanding the differences in ride durations can help in targeted marketing campaigns. If casual riders tend to take longer rides on specific days or from starting stations, marketing efforts can be tailored to attract more casual riders during those times or locations.

Product Development Teams: Insights into ride durations can inform the development of subscription plans or pricing structures. If members tend to take consistently shorter rides on weekdays from specific stations, there could be opportunities to offer targeted subscription packages incentivizing shorter rides for regular commuters.

Data Analysts and Researchers: Professionals in these roles can delve deeper into this data to identify patterns and correlations that might not be immediately evident. This can lead to more nuanced insights, helping businesses make data-driven decisions in various aspects of operations and strategy.

Customer Experience and Support Teams: Understanding user behavior regarding ride durations can also help in improving user experiences. For instance, if there are stations or days where riders tend to face issues or longer wait times due to high demand, customer support strategies can be adapted accordingly.
