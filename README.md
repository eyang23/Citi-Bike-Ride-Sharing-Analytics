# Citi-Bike-Ride-Sharing-Analytics
Finals Project


The main goal of this project is to analyze the extensive data generated by the New York Citi Bike program. Its aim is to deeply understand how bikes are used and create predictive models that accurately forecast bike usage patterns. By exploring the factors that affect when, where, and how Citi Bikes are utilized, the project seeks to offer valuable insights for improving the bike-sharing system. This involves efficiently distributing bikes to areas with high demand, scheduling maintenance effectively, and being proactive in adapting to changes in rider behavior influenced by external factors such as weather, events, and demographics. The purpose of this project is to enhance the overall experience of using Citi Bikes, support sustainable urban transportation, and contribute to the evolution of smarter urban mobility solutions in the lively city of New York.
