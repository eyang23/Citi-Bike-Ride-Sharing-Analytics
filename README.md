# Citi-Bike-Ride-Sharing-Analytics
Finals Project


The main goal of this project is to analyze the extensive data generated by the New York Citi Bike program. Its aim is to deeply understand how bikes are used and create predictive models that accurately forecast bike usage patterns. By exploring the factors that affect when, where, and how Citi Bikes are utilized, the project seeks to offer valuable insights for improving the bike-sharing system. This involves efficiently distributing bikes to areas with high demand, scheduling maintenance effectively, and being proactive in adapting to changes in rider behavior influenced by external factors such as weather, events, and demographics. The purpose of this project is to enhance the overall experience of using Citi Bikes, support sustainable urban transportation, and contribute to the evolution of smarter urban mobility solutions in the lively city of New York.

There are four folders.

Data:
We'll access Citibike trip files available on the official website Citi Bike System Data. 
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/NYC-BigApps/Citi-Bike-System-Data/vsnr-94wk

The focus is on importing trip data covering the years 2016 through 2023 to facilitate a comprehensive analysis.

Visualizing with Final Findings:
Utilizing bar charts, the connections being investigated will be illustrated.
The analysis will examine the findings, revealing conclusive insights in sets of three.

Codes:
The execution involves developing and implementing RStudio codes dedicated to data analysis and visualization.

Business Case Reports:
The exploration will dive into the preferred days for bike rides among members compared to casual riders, examining potential correlations. The investigation will show how geographical locations influence bike usage patterns at different times of the day. The analysis will focus on ride durations, comparing members and casual riders based on the day of the week and their starting station.
